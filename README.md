## Overview
RECAST introduces a lightweight retrieval-augmented framework for contextual ASR.  
It leverages decoder-state embeddings of a pretrained ASR model to retrieve and bias relevant keywords from large dictionaries, achieving strong improvements in WER and entity recall across diverse domains and languages.

## Status
ðŸš§ Code will be added soon. Stay tuned!
